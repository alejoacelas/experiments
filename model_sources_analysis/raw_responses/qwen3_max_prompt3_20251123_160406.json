Hinton** \"for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.\"\n\n- **John J. Hopfield** developed a structure known as the **Hopfield network**, which can store and reconstruct patterns\u2014such as images or data\u2014using principles inspired by physics.\n- **Geoffrey E. Hinton** invented a method called **backpropagation**, which allows neural networks to learn from errors and improve over time, forming the backbone of modern deep learning.\n\nTheir work bridges physics, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience, and has had a profound impact on the development of artificial intelligence."
